Licence Plate Detection & Recognition with YOLOv10 and PaddleOCR

License Plate Detection & Recognition | Save Data to SQL Database
In this video ?, we will explore how to perform License Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLOv10 and PaddleOCR. We will use YOLOv10 to detect license plates and PaddleOCR to read the text from the detected license plates. Additionally, we will generate a JSON file every 20 seconds, which will contain the start time, end time, and detected license plate data for that interval. We will also create a cumulative JSON file that is updated with new interval data every 20 seconds while retaining previous entries without duplication. Finally, we will save the license plate detection data to an SQL database.
